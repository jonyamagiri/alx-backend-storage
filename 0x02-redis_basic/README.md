# 0x02. Redis basic

> This repository contains the tasks for `Redis basic` project and a description of what each program or function does:


## Learning Objectives

	* Learn how to use redis for basic operations
	* Learn how to use redis as a simple cache


* Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports a wide range of data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Redis is often used in web applications for its speed, simplicity, and flexibility.

* Redis can be used as a cache to improve the performance of web applications. By caching frequently accessed data in Redis, you can reduce the number of database queries and speed up the response time of your application. In this example, we will use Redis as a simple cache to store the result of an expensive function.
